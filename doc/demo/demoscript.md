# Demonstration script
Welcome to IT Support demonstration, which handles conversation for internal IT application support.

# Use case
The support director wants to modernize the way to support internal staff and offload his team from basic work. Currently 20000 tickets are issued in a year. 50% of the calls are answered in 7 minutes whereas there are many situations that reach up to 70 minutes for resolution. 92% of the calls are resolved by level 1 support. Employees of the Case Inc engage with customer support mostly through phones. Today, call center agents struggle to find some of the answers in a timely fashion as the systems are not integrated. This results in loss of productivity and frustration on the part of the bank employees. Level 1 support team get frustrated at times because of unavailability of the right information and proper guidance. The Level 1 support has to consult the Level 2 support team members to get some answers.

You can now ask simple questions like:
* I could not access application AbC
*  How can I reset my password
* what is the business process for supplier on boarding?
* how to bring my ipad for work?

### Triggering a business process from the conversation

The supplier on boarding business process deployed on [IBM BPM on Cloud](https://vhost001.bpm.ibmcloud.com/) can be triggered automatically by this conversation broker code as defined in the dialog flow.

The diagram above illustrates the dialog flow to support the **supplier on boarding** intent classification. The Watson response is **Do you want me to trigger the process for you?**. Then when the user answers *yes* the flow is asking for company name and then product name.

To demonstrate you need an account on BPM on Cloud demo server and do the following steps:

* How to access supplier on boarding process
* for company name enter IBM
* for product name enter Watson or another IBM product

The process is created and the business process calls Watson Discovery to search the company / product in the *News* collection, as illustrated by the process flow:

The user can then claim a task in his working basket on BPM Process portal
![Process Portal](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cognitive-supplier-process/blob/master/docs/SOBD-processcenter.png)  

To see the search results and assess the risk to add this supplier as business partner.

If accepted the supplier is added to the blockchain network.

## Integrate Chatbot

The chat bot user interface can be embedded inside a BPM coach and called from a *Get help* button. The action triggers a popup window, which is an iframe, which call the conversation broker user interface to the url: [http://refarch-wcs-broker.mybluemix.net/conversation/sodb](http://refarch-wcs-broker.mybluemix.net/conversation/sodb).  
As illustrated in the screen shot below:
